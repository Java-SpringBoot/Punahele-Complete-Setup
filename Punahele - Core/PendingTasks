The front end should request for more frames as and when needed.
When the page loads, make sure that some frames related to that video are already in memory.
Or at least a screenshot should be fine.
Make sure that A Redis like server (or any cache provider) is setup, and frames are stored on it.
And ensure that all the videos have their corresponding File handler (RandomAccessFile) cached

Kafka.
Multiple user requests arrive at the server. The requests will be queued together.
The websocket onmessage method will be asynchronous (Figure out how to call one)
Then multiple threads will be picking up requests from the queue, call the appropriate video file,
and put the data to Kafka(Check how to do this).
Then data will be read from Kafka and each request will be served accordingly.
Remember, websocket is multi threaded. Each onmessage method will be called in a separate thread
